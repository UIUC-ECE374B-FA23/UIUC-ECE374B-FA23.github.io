I will not be teaching ECE374B in Spring 2025 and will instead be teaching [ECE364](https://eceml.com/), a course dedicated to teaching applied machine learning through PyTorch. Feel free to check us out. My one regret is that I won't be able to work with my amazing team this semester. To my incredible TAs, I can't thank you enough for your hard work and loyalty these many years. Hopefully, we can get the gang back together soon but in the meantime, remember your allies are still out there.
